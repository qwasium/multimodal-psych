## Guide for multimodal physiological measurements

In this README, we will first discuss general ideas of multimodal physiological measurements.  
Then, we will describe the details of how we combined fNIRS(ETG-4000) and psychopysiplogical measurement device(Polymate ) as in the paper.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Generally speaking, it is good to know the basics of computer sciense.
